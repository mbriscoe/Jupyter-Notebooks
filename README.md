## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed
- Basic familiarity with Python (helpful but not required)

### Installation

If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter notebook numpy pandas matplotlib
```

Or using conda:

```bash
conda install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Open `jupyter_notebook_guide.ipynb` in your browser
5. Follow along by reading and executing cells sequentially

### Using in VS Code

If you're using Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
2. Open the `jupyter_notebook_guide.ipynb` file
3. Select a Python kernel when prompted
4. Start executing cells!

## 💡 How to Use This Guide

- **Read and Execute**: Go through each cell in order, reading the explanations and running the code
- **Experiment**: Modify the code examples to see what happens
- **Practice**: Try creating your own cells to practice the concepts
- **Reference**: Use this notebook as a quick reference when working on other projects

## 📖 Learning Path

Each section builds on previous concepts, so it's recommended to follow the guide sequentially. However, if you're already familiar with certain topics, feel free to jump to specific sections using the notebook's table of contents.

**Summary Sections**: Each major topic includes a collapsible summary box highlighting the key takeaways.
